# Motivation
Data Scieneer is a trial-and-error Data [Science / Engineering] system, meant as a generalist's learn-by-doing journey. As has been the case for JavaScript frameworks, the word _data_ has become a [sea of mirrors](https://xkcd.com/927/). Instead of coming up with a new standard, within this project we'll try to apply critical thinking in applying and ranking existing ones in messy, real world problems.  
You'll be able to navigate through live implementations of some of the major Data Engineering tools and Data Science frameworks, and see how each one fairs against the others. Of course, tools alone don't make a project - their use does. This is what we aim to prove.
